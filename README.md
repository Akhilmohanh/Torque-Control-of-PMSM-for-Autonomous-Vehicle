# Torque-Control-of-PMSM-for-Autonomous-Vehicle
Project is mainly focused on controlling torque of autonomous vehicle having regenerative braking system for braking applications. Using FOC methods, current values in d-q reference frames is controlled in close loop according to updates from sensor and IMU(Inertial Measurement Unit).
