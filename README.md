# Torque-Control-of-PMSM-for-Autonomous-Vehicle
Project is mainly focused on controlling torque of autonomous vehicle having regenerative braking system for braking applications. Using FOC methods, current values in d-q reference frames is controlled in close loop according to updates from sensor and IMU(Inertial Measurement Unit).

Objective : The goal of this project is to design and implement a torque control-based Field-Oriented Control (FOC) strategy for braking a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) in an EV. The focus will be on energy-efficient regenerative braking, which recovers kinetic energy during braking and improves battery performance.
